/home/jtjohn26/CSE_645_Project/test_model.py:42: LangChainDeprecationWarning: The class `ChatOpenAI` was deprecated in LangChain 0.0.10 and will be removed in 1.0. An updated version of the class exists in the :class:`~langchain-openai package and should be used instead. To use it run `pip install -U :class:`~langchain-openai` and import as `from :class:`~langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI``.
  eval_llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name = eval_model_name, temperature = 1.0)
