Context:
Undernutrition in neonates increases the risk of serious morbidities. The objective of this study was to describe neonatal morbidity associated with low body fat percentage (BF%) and measure the number of undernourished neonates defined by BF% and compare this with birth weight percentiles (<10th). Eligibility included term (≥37 wk) neonates. BF% measurements were undertaken by air displacement plethysmography. Data on neonatal outcomes were extracted from medical records and used to develop a measure of neonatal morbidity. We assessed the association between neonatal morbidity and population-based birth weight percentiles compared with the BF% measurements. Five hundred and eighty-one neonates were included. Low BF% was defined by 1 SD below the mean and identified in 73 per 1,000 live births. Neonatal morbidity was found in 3.4% of neonates. Birth weight percentile was associated with neonatal morbidity (odds ratio (OR): 1.03 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.05); P =<0.001). BF% was associated with a higher risk of neonatal morbidity (OR: 1.30 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.47); P =<0.001).
Question:
Is body fat percentage a better measure of undernutrition in newborns than birth weight percentiles?
[/INST]
 Generated Answer: Yes, based on the study you provided, it appears that body fat percentage is a better measure of undernutrition in newborns than birth weight percentiles. Here's why:

The study found that low body fat percentage (defined as 1 standard deviation below the mean) was associated with an increased risk of neonatal morbidity, whereas birth weight percentile was only weakly associated with neonatal morbidity (odds ratio for birth weight percentile vs. odds ratio for body fat percentage). This suggests that body fat percentage may be a more sensitive indicator of undernutrition in newborns than birth weight percentiles.

Additionally, the study found that 73 per 1,000 live births had low body fat percentages, which is significantly higher than the proportion of neonates with low birth weights (26 per 1,000 live births). This suggests that


Provided Answer: In this population, measuring BF% is more closely associated with identification of neonates at risk of neonatal morbidity as compared with birth weight percentiles. BF% measurements could assist with identifying neonates who are appropriately grown yet undernourished and exclude small neonates not at risk.


LangChain Evaluation Metrics:
correctness: 0.4
Reasoning:
The answer correctly concludes that body fat percentage is more closely associated with neonatal morbidity than birth weight percentiles, aligning with the reported stronger association (OR 1.30 vs 1.03). However, it introduces an unsubstantiated statistic (26 per 1,000 for low birth weight percentiles) that is not provided in the context and leaves the final sentence incomplete. These issues reduce its correctness and reliability.

conciseness: 0.4
Reasoning:
The response answers the question correctly with a clear “yes” and briefly references the stronger association (ORs) for BF% versus birth weight percentiles. However, it is not optimally concise: it includes unnecessary elaboration, introduces an extraneous and likely unsupported comparison of prevalence, and ends with an incomplete sentence. A more concise answer would directly state BF% is more closely associated with neonatal morbidity and can better identify undernourished neonates.

relevance: 0.6
Reasoning:
The response is generally relevant and aligns with the study’s conclusion that BF% is more strongly associated with neonatal morbidity than birth weight percentiles, reflecting the ORs (1.30 vs 1.03) and correctly noting that low BF% was defined as 1 SD below the mean and occurred in 73 per 1,000 live births. However, it introduces an unsupported statistic (“26 per 1,000 live births” for low birth weight) that is not in the provided text, and the final sentence is incomplete. It also omits the nuance that BF% can identify appropriately grown yet undernourished neonates and exclude small neonates not at risk.

coherence: 0.3
Reasoning:
The response starts clearly, answers the question directly, and provides a brief rationale comparing the associations (ORs), which supports the claim. However, it includes an unsupported and likely incorrect statistic about low birth weight prevalence, and the final sentence is truncated, leaving the thought unfinished. These issues disrupt the flow and coherence of the answer.

helpfulness: 0.3
Reasoning:
The answer correctly concludes that BF% is a better measure than birth weight percentiles and notes the stronger association with neonatal morbidity, aligning with the study’s findings. However, it introduces an unsupported statistic (26 per 1,000) not present in the context and ends mid-sentence, making it incomplete. It also misses the key nuance that BF% can identify undernourished but appropriately grown neonates and exclude small but not-at-risk neonates.

Context:
We retrospectively collected and analyzed data of all diabetic patients affected by Charcot neuroarthropathy in combination with critical limb ischemia, which arrived to our care for the presence of foot lesions and underwent endovascular revascularization, followed by surgical and orthopedic treatment between January 2010 and January 2012. The primary end point was to assess the limb salvage rate. The secondary end point was to evaluate the healing time of the lesions. Ten diabetic patients (10 men; mean age 69.1±8.5 years), affected by ischemic Charcot neuroarthropathy underwent endovascular revascularization, surgical debridement and orthopedic correction. The limb salvage rate was 90%, avoiding major amputation in 9 patients. In one patient (10%) the infection could not be controlled and below-the-knee amputation was carried out. The required time to heal the lesion was in mean 197.4±22.4 days, after revascularization, surgical and orthopedic treatment.
Question:
Ischemic Charcot foot: different disease with different treatment?
[/INST]
 Generated Answer: Yes, ischemic Charcot foot is considered a distinct entity from non-ischemic Charcot foot, with differences in etiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and treatment approaches. Here's why:

1. Etiology: Ischemia plays a crucial role in the development and progression of ischemic Charcot foot. Reduced blood flow due to peripheral artery disease or other vasoconstrictive conditions can cause damage to the sensory nerves, leading to painless ulceration and eventual collapse of the foot. Non-ischemic Charcot foot, on the other hand, typically results from neural compression or trauma without any underlying vascular abnormalities.
2. Pathophysiology: Ischemia exacerbates the symptoms of Charcot foot by promoting bone remodeling, increased muscle atrophy, and altered


Provided Answer: Patients with Charcot foot deformity can be affected by critical limb ischemia and revascularization therapy is necessary, to support surgical and orthopedic treatment, avoiding amputation and leading to limb and foot salvage.


LangChain Evaluation Metrics:
correctness: 0.2
Reasoning:
The response is incomplete and contains factual inaccuracies. It incorrectly frames “ischemic Charcot foot” as a distinct disease caused by ischemia, whereas classic Charcot neuroarthropathy is primarily due to neuropathy, with ischemia being a coexisting condition that significantly impacts management. It also mischaracterizes non-ischemic Charcot as due to neural compression/trauma. Crucially, it fails to address the key management point supported by the context and ground truth: that in Charcot patients with critical limb ischemia, revascularization is necessary to enable surgical/orthopedic treatment, avoid major amputation, and achieve high limb salvage rates.

conciseness: 0.3
Reasoning:
The response is not concise. It launches into a broad discussion of etiology and pathophysiology rather than directly answering the targeted clinical question about management. It omits the key concise takeaway from the context—that ischemic Charcot foot requires revascularization to support surgical/orthopedic care and improve limb salvage—and the answer is also truncated.

relevance: 0.2
Reasoning:
The response does not reference the provided study or quote from the text. It fails to mention the key finding that revascularization is necessary to support surgical and orthopedic treatment, leading to high limb salvage rates and specific healing times. It also includes questionable generalizations about etiology and pathophysiology unrelated to the text. Therefore, it is not well aligned with the given context.

coherence: 0.3
Reasoning:
The response starts with a structured approach and an explicit thesis, but it is truncated mid-sentence and leaves key sections unfinished, which disrupts flow and coherence. The numbered list is incomplete, there is no conclusion tying back to the question, and transitions are lacking. Overall, the organization is only partially developed and the answer reads as abruptly cut off, harming coherence.

helpfulness: 0.2
Reasoning:
The response is incomplete and does not address the key clinical takeaway from the provided context: that in Charcot foot with critical limb ischemia, endovascular revascularization is necessary to support surgical and orthopedic treatment, enabling limb salvage and avoiding major amputation. It also contains questionable pathophysiology (implying ischemia as a primary cause of Charcot and attributing non-ischemic cases to neural compression) and fails to mention the reported outcomes (90% limb salvage, ~197-day healing). Overall, it is neither concise nor aligned with the study’s findings.

Context:
Radical hysterectomy is recommended for endometrial adenocarcinoma patients with suspected gross cervical involvement. However, the efficacy of operative procedure has not been confirmed. The patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma who had suspected gross cervical involvement and underwent hysterectomy between 1995 and 2009 at seven institutions were retrospectively analysed (Gynecologic Oncology Trial and Investigation Consortium of North Kanto: GOTIC-005). Primary endpoint was overall survival, and secondary endpoints were progression-free survival and adverse effects. A total of 300 patients who underwent primary surgery were identified: 74 cases with radical hysterectomy (RH), 112 patients with modified radical hysterectomy (mRH), and 114 cases with simple hysterectomy (SH). Median age was 47 years, and median duration of follow-up was 47 months. There were no significant differences of age, performance status, body mass index, stage distribution, and adjuvant therapy among three groups. Multi-regression analysis revealed that age, grade, peritoneal cytology status, and lymph node involvement were identified as prognostic factors for OS; however, type of hysterectomy was not selected as independent prognostic factor for local recurrence-free survival, PFS, and OS. Additionally, patients treated with RH had longer operative time, higher rates of blood transfusion and severe urinary tract dysfunction.
Question:
Surgery for endometrial cancers with suspected cervical involvement: is radical hysterectomy needed (a GOTIC study)?
[/INST]
 Generated Answer: Yes, according to the GOTIC-005 study you provided, radical hysterectomy (RH) may be necessary for patients with endometrial cancer and suspected gross cervical involvement. While the study did not confirm the efficacy of RH in improving overall survival (OS), it found that RH was associated with better outcomes in terms of local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and operative time compared to other types of hysterectomies such as modified radical hysterectomy (MRH) or simple hysterectomy (SH).

The study included 300 patients who underwent primary surgery for endometrial adenocarcinoma with suspected gross cervical involvement between 1995 and 2009 at seven institutions. Of these, 74 patients received


Provided Answer: Type of hysterectomy was not identified as a prognostic factor in endometrial cancer patients with suspected gross cervical involvement. Perioperative and late adverse events were more frequent in patients treated with RH. The present study could not find any survival benefit from RH for endometrial cancer patients with suspected gross cervical involvement. Surgical treatment in these patients should be further evaluated in prospective clinical studies.


LangChain Evaluation Metrics:
correctness: 0.1
Reasoning:
The assistant’s answer contradicts the study’s findings. The GOTIC-005 study did not show that radical hysterectomy (RH) is necessary or beneficial; type of hysterectomy was not an independent prognostic factor for LRFS, PFS, or OS. Moreover, RH was associated with longer operative time and more adverse events, not better operative metrics. The response thus misrepresents both efficacy and morbidity outcomes.

conciseness: 0.1
Reasoning:
The response contradicts the study’s findings: it asserts RH may be necessary and claims better LRFS/PFS and operative time, whereas the study found no survival or recurrence benefit from RH and more adverse events with longer operative time. It is also incomplete and not concise, adding incorrect details and trailing off mid-answer.

relevance: 0.1
Reasoning:
The assistant’s answer misrepresents the study’s findings. The provided text explicitly states that the type of hysterectomy was not an independent prognostic factor for local recurrence-free survival, progression-free survival, or overall survival, and that RH had longer operative time and more adverse events. The answer incorrectly claims RH may be necessary and suggests better LRFS, PFS, and operative time with RH, which contradicts the text. Thus, it does not accurately reference the real quote or its conclusions.

coherence: 0.1
Reasoning:
The response is incoherent and poorly structured. It contradicts the provided context by claiming RH may be necessary and associated with better LRFS, PFS, and operative time, whereas the reference states no survival benefit and more adverse events with RH, including longer operative time. It is also incomplete, ending mid-sentence, and presents internal inconsistencies (acknowledging no OS benefit while asserting other benefits not supported by the data). Overall, it lacks logical consistency and clear organization.

helpfulness: 0.1
Reasoning:
The assistant’s response is not helpful or accurate relative to the provided context and ground truth. It incorrectly suggests that radical hysterectomy (RH) may be necessary and claims RH had better LRFS, PFS, and operative time, which contradicts the study’s findings. The GOTIC-005 study found no survival benefit or prognostic impact of hysterectomy type (including RH) on LRFS, PFS, or OS, and RH was associated with longer operative time and more adverse events (e.g., transfusions, urinary dysfunction). The answer is also truncated and omits key safety and conclusions, making it misleading.

Context:
The morbidity and mortality of pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) have significantly decreased over the past decades to the point that they are no longer the sole indicators of quality and safety. In recent times, hospital readmission is increasingly used as a quality metric for surgical performance and has direct implications on health-care costs. We sought to delineate the natural history and predictive factors of readmissions after PD. The clinicopathologic and long-term follow-up data of 1,173 consecutive patients who underwent PD between August 2002 and August 2012 at the Massachusetts General Hospital were reviewed. The NSQIP database was linked with our clinical database to supplement perioperative data. Readmissions unrelated to the index admission were omitted. We identified 173 (15 %) patients who required readmission after PD within the study period. The readmission rate was higher in the second half of the decade when compared to the first half (18.6 vs 12.3 %, p = 0.003), despite a stable 7-day median length of stay. Readmitted patients were analyzed against those without readmissions after PD. The demographics and tumor pathology of both groups did not differ significantly. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, pancreatic fistula (18.5 vs 11.3 %, OR 1.86, p = 0.004), multivisceral resection at time of PD (3.5 vs 0.6 %, OR 4.02, p = 0.02), length of initial hospital stay>7 days (59.5 vs 42.5 %, OR 1.57, p = 0.01), and ICU admissions (11.6 vs 3.4 %, OR 2.90, p = 0.0005) were independently associated with readmissions. There were no postoperative biochemical variables that were predictive of readmissions. Fifty percent (n = 87) of the readmissions occurred within 7 days from initial operative discharge. The reasons for immediate (≤7 days) and nonimmediate (>7 days) readmissions differed; ileus, delayed gastric emptying, and pneumonia were more common in early readmissions, whereas wound infection, failure to thrive, and intra-abdominal hemorrhage were associated with late readmissions. The incidences of readmissions due to pancreatic fistulas and intra-abdominal abscesses were equally distributed between both time frames. The frequency of readmission after PD is 15 % and has been on the uptrend over the last decade.
Question:
Understanding hospital readmissions after pancreaticoduodenectomy: can we prevent them?
[/INST]
 Generated Answer: Yes, there are several strategies that may help prevent or reduce hospital readmissions after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD):

1. Enhanced recovery protocols: Implementing enhanced recovery programs that focus on optimizing perioperative care, minimizing unnecessary interventions, and promoting early ambulation can improve outcomes and reduce readmissions.
2. Proper patient selection: Carefully selecting patients based on their individual risks and comorbidities can help identify those who may be at high risk for complications and readmissions. This includes considering factors such as age, sex, co-morbidities, and tumor characteristics.
3. Surgical technique improvements: Developing and implementing new surgical techniques, such as hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery or single-incision laparoscopic surgery, which offer improved visualization and reduced trauma, may lead to fewer comp


Provided Answer: The complexity of initial resection and pancreatic fistula were independently associated with hospital readmissions after PD. Further efforts should be centered on preventing early readmissions, which constitute half of all readmissions.


LangChain Evaluation Metrics:
correctness: 0.2
Reasoning:
The response does not reflect the key findings from the provided study. It fails to identify the independent predictors of readmission (pancreatic fistula and complexity/multivisceral resection) and incorrectly emphasizes demographics/tumor characteristics, which were not significant. It also omits the crucial point that half of readmissions occur within 7 days and that prevention efforts should focus on early readmissions with specific causes (ileus, delayed gastric emptying, pneumonia). Additionally, it introduces speculative strategies (e.g., laparoscopic approaches) not supported by the study and the answer is truncated.

conciseness: 0.2
Reasoning:
The response is not concise or aligned with the study’s key findings. It offers generic, speculative strategies and omits the specific predictors identified (pancreatic fistula and complexity of initial resection) and the emphasis on preventing early readmissions (half occur within 7 days). It is also truncated, further reducing clarity and conciseness.

relevance: 0.1
Reasoning:
The response is generic and does not reference the specific findings from the provided text. It fails to mention that pancreatic fistula and complexity of initial resection were independently associated with readmissions, nor does it address the key point that half of readmissions occur within 7 days and should be a focus for prevention. It also introduces suggestions (e.g., specific laparoscopic techniques) not supported by the text and is incomplete.

coherence: 0.2
Reasoning:
The response is partially structured with bullet points, but it is incomplete and ends mid-sentence, which undermines coherence. It also offers generic strategies that do not align with or synthesize the specific findings in the provided context (e.g., pancreatic fistula and complexity of resection as independent predictors, and the focus on early readmissions). Overall, it lacks a clear, cohesive connection to the study’s results and is truncated.

helpfulness: 0.2
Reasoning:
The response is generic, does not engage with the study’s specific findings, and is truncated. It fails to mention the identified independent predictors of readmission (pancreatic fistula, multivisceral resection, longer initial stay, ICU admission), the 15% rate, the timing (50% within 7 days), or the differing causes of early vs late readmissions. It also suggests surgical approaches not supported by the provided evidence. Overall, it is not aligned with the reference and provides limited, incomplete guidance.

Context:
Although many studies have explored gender role expectations of pain behaviours in different cultures, only a few authors have tried to explore whether certain pains are more associated with the typical man or woman. Hence, this study aimed at exploring, among Portuguese laypeople and nurses, patterns of common pains more strongly associated with the typical man or woman, and their relationship with health-care training and personal pain experiences. A total of 68 nurses (76% women) and 55 laypeople (62% women) were asked to identify, through free association, the most frequent common pains that people in general associate with the typical man and woman, respectively, and also to report their personal past pain experiences. A content analysis was used to categorize and quantify participants' responses. A multiple correspondence analysis was performed to identify gendered patterns of common pains, followed by a cluster analysis to classify participants according to their endorsed patterns. Findings showed that while 'back and musculoskeletal pains' was the only pattern associated with the typical man, more differentiated patterns of pains were associated with the typical woman, namely (1) headaches; (2) abdominal, back and musculoskeletal pains; and (3) pains due to hormonal cycles, labour/puerperium and from the urinary/reproductive system. These representations were shared by laypeople and nurses and were only significantly associated with personal experiences of pains from the urinary/reproductive system.
Question:
Is it a (fe)male pain?
[/INST]
 Generated Answer: According to the study you provided, there are some differences in the types of pains that are commonly associated with men and women. Here are some key findings related to your question:

* Men are more likely to be associated with "back and musculoskeletal pains" than any other type of pain.
* Women are associated with several distinct patterns of pains, including:
	+ Headaches
	+ Abdominal, back, and musculoskeletal pains
	+ Pains due to hormonal cycles, labor/puerperium, and from the urinary/reproductive system.

It is important to note that these associations are based on self-report data from both laypeople and nurses, and may not reflect actual differences in pain experience or expression between men and women. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of considering cultural and social factors in understanding how gender roles shape perception


Provided Answer: This study identified different gendered patterns of common pains, which may have important implications for (wo)men's pain experiences and how these are interpreted by others.


LangChain Evaluation Metrics:
correctness: 0.8
Reasoning:
The assistant’s answer accurately reflects the study’s key findings: men were mainly associated with back/musculoskeletal pain, while women were associated with multiple patterns including headaches, abdominal/back/musculoskeletal, and hormonal/reproductive-related pains. It appropriately notes that these are associations and may be influenced by social factors. However, it omits that these representations were shared by both laypeople and nurses and that only pains from the urinary/reproductive system were significantly linked to personal experience. The final sentence is also cut off.

conciseness: 0.7
Reasoning:
The response is generally concise and focuses on the study’s key findings, listing male- and female-associated pain patterns clearly. However, it could be tighter by directly answering the question upfront and omitting filler (e.g., “According to the study you provided”). The final sentence trails off, adding words without value. Overall, it’s succinct but not maximally so.

relevance: 0.8
Reasoning:
The assistant’s answer accurately reflects the study’s findings: it correctly identifies that back/musculoskeletal pain was associated with the typical man and that women were associated with multiple patterns (headaches; abdominal/back/musculoskeletal; hormonal/labour/urinary-reproductive). It also appropriately cautions about interpretation. However, it does not explicitly reference or quote the key concluding point about implications for how pain is interpreted by others, and the final sentence is cut off. Overall, it is relevant and consistent with the text but slightly incomplete.

coherence: 0.7
Reasoning:
The response is generally coherent and well-structured, using clear bullet points to summarize the study’s findings and adding a relevant caveat about perception versus actual experience. However, it ends with an incomplete sentence and lacks a concluding statement directly tying back to the question, which slightly disrupts coherence.

helpfulness: 0.7
Reasoning:
The response accurately summarizes the study’s main findings: back/musculoskeletal pain being associated with men, and multiple patterns (headaches; abdominal/back/musculoskeletal; hormonal/reproductive-related) being associated with women. It also appropriately cautions that these are perceived associations. However, it omits that these representations were shared by both laypeople and nurses and that only urinary/reproductive pains were significantly linked to personal pain experiences.

Context:
The hypothesis of this study is that pelvic obliquity (PO) is associated with specific patterns of degenerative scoliosis. This study was a retrospective case series of consecutive patients undergoing fusion for lumbar conditions (degenerative scoliosis or spondylolisthesis). The discrepancy in the iliac crest height, coronal L1-S1 endplate angles, distance from L1 coronal bisector to the sacral center, number of degenerative scoliosis curves, and individual curve angulations were measured. Limb length discrepancy was present in 87% of patients with a degenerative scoliosis. There were 116 patients with a single curve>5° and PO>2 cm. Of the patients with a single curve, the apex of scoliosis was opposite the high iliac crest side in 79% patients. There were 338 patients with a double curve. The apex of scoliosis was opposite the high iliac crest side in 48% of patients.
Question:
Is pelvic obliquity related to degenerative scoliosis?
[/INST]
 Generated Answer: Yes, according to the study you provided, there is a significant relationship between pelvic obliquity (PO) and degenerative scoliosis. The study found that:

* In patients with a single curve greater than 5°, the apex of scoliosis was located on the same side as the high iliac crest in 79% of cases.
* In patients with two curved segments, the apex of scoliosis was located on the same side as the high iliac crest in 48% of cases.

These findings suggest that there may be an association between pelvic obliquity and the development of degenerative scoliosis, particularly when it comes to the location of the apex of scoliosis within the body. However, further studies are needed to confirm these results and establish the exact nature of this relationship.


Provided Answer: There were distinct patterns of limb length discrepancy corresponding to degenerative scoliotic curve morphology. In patients with single degenerative scoliotic curves, PO most commonly appeared to counteract the scoliotic curve and result in an overall decrease in trunk shift. This occurred because the high iliac crest was observed most commonly on the convex side of the scoliotic curve. This effect was not observed in double lumbar degenerative scoliotic curves.


LangChain Evaluation Metrics:
correctness: 0.2
Reasoning:
The answer correctly states that pelvic obliquity is related to degenerative scoliosis, but it misreports the key findings. The study found the apex of scoliosis was opposite the high iliac crest in 79% of single-curve cases and 48% of double-curve cases, not on the same side as stated. It also misses the nuance that in single degenerative curves PO tended to counteract the curve and reduce trunk shift, an effect not seen in double curves. These are substantial factual inaccuracies.

conciseness: 0.3
Reasoning:
The response is not concise: it includes a generic preface and an unnecessary caveat about needing further studies. More importantly, it misstates the key finding by claiming the apex is on the same side as the high iliac crest, whereas the study reports it is opposite in most single-curve cases. Given the focus on conciseness and the presence of extraneous text plus incorrect details, the quality is low.

relevance: 0.2
Reasoning:
The response correctly concludes that pelvic obliquity is related to degenerative scoliosis, but it misrepresents the study’s specific findings. The provided context states that the apex of scoliosis was opposite the high iliac crest in 79% of single-curve cases and 48% of double-curve cases, indicating PO tends to counteract the curve. The assistant’s answer incorrectly claims the apex was on the same side as the high iliac crest for both groups. Therefore, it does not accurately refer to the text.

coherence: 0.7
Reasoning:
The response is clearly structured and easy to follow: it starts with a direct answer, lists key findings in bullet points, and ends with a concise conclusion. However, it inverts the reported relationships (stating the apex is on the same side as the high iliac crest rather than opposite), which conflicts with the provided context. While this is primarily a factual error, it undermines the coherence relative to the source, as the narrative claims to reflect the study but misstates its key directional findings.

helpfulness: 0.2
Reasoning:
The response correctly asserts that pelvic obliquity is related to degenerative scoliosis, but it misinterprets key findings. The study reports that in single-curve cases the apex of scoliosis is opposite the high iliac crest in 79% of patients (not on the same side), indicating PO tends to counteract the curve and reduce trunk shift. It also misstates the double-curve finding (48% opposite, not same side). These directional errors undermine the core conclusion and omit the nuance that the counteracting effect was not seen in double curves.
